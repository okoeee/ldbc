Tips for submitting an issue with ldbc (read before you submit an issue):

**DESCRIPTION:**

Give a short, clear description of the issue. Make sure the title also describes the issue as well as possible.

**STEPS TO REPRODUCE:**

Describe steps on how to reproduce the bug. Include a bare-bones test case (as small as possible) that demonstrates the bug.

**EXPECTED RESULT:**

Describe what you expected to see and why.

**ACTUAL RESULT:**

Describe what you saw. If you got compiler errors or exceptions, include them. When including an exception stack traces, make sure to include also the root cause (search for "Caused by:" in the stack trace).

**SETUP:**

Describe your set-up (database used, profile, configuration, etc)

As with feature requests, note that ldbc is a community project and the best way to get bugs fixed is to submit a pull request for fixing it, along with a test case that demonstrates the bug existed prior to the PR and does not after the PR.
