ldbc (Lepus Database Connectivity) is Pure functional JDBC layer with Cats Effect 3 and Scala 3.

ldbc is Created under the influence of [tapir](https://github.com/softwaremill/tapir), a declarative, type-safe web endpoint library. Using tapir, you can build type-safe endpoints and also generate OpenAPI documentation from the endpoints you build.

ldbc allows the same type-safe construction with Scala at the database layer and document generation using the constructed one.

Note that **ldbc** is pre-1.0 software and is still undergoing active development. New versions are **not** binary compatible with prior versions, although in most cases user code will be source compatible.
