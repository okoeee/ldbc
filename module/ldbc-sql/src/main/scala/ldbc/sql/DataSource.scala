/** A factory for connections to the physical data source that this DataSource object represents. An alternative to the
  * DriverManager facility, a DataSource object is the preferred means of getting a connection. An object that
  * implements the DataSource interface will typically be registered with a naming service based on the Javaâ„¢ Naming and
  * Directory (JNDI) API. <P> The DataSource interface is implemented by a driver vendor. There are three types of
  * implementations: <P> <OL> <LI>Basic implementation -- produces a standard Connection object <LI>Connection pooling
  * implementation -- produces a Connection object that will automatically participate in connection pooling. This
  * implementation works with a middle-tier connection pooling manager. <LI>Distributed transaction implementation --
  * produces a Connection object that may be used for distributed transactions and almost always participates in
  * connection pooling. This implementation works with a middle-tier transaction manager and almost always with a
  * connection pooling manager. </OL> <P> A DataSource object has properties that can be modified when necessary. For
  * example, if the data source is moved to a different server, the property for the server can be changed. The benefit
  * is that because the data source's properties can be changed, any code accessing that data source does not need to be
  * changed. <P> A driver that is accessed via a DataSource object does not register itself with the DriverManager.
  * Rather, a DataSource object is retrieved through a lookup operation and then used to create a Connection object.
  * With a basic implementation, the connection obtained through a DataSource object is identical to a connection
  * obtained through the DriverManager facility.
